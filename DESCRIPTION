Description: We provide a novel semiparametric single-index method to test the relationship between the covariate(s) of interest and zero-inflated data. By inputting the response variable, explanatory variable(s), the indices of the variables to be tested, and the method to be used, we can test the relationship between the variables of interest and the zero-inflated response variable.
